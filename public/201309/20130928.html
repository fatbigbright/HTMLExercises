    <h1>20130928</h1>
    <p>From today, I will spend several days to follow Chapter 16 of the book &lt;HTML, XHTML &amp; CSS 6th edition&gt; to create a page with table. During this period, page of every day will be copied from the one edited yesterday and updated.</p>
    <div id="notes">
        <ul>
            <li>border (X)HTML property of table is inheritable, while border CSS property of table is not. Which means the former one will cause all the children elements will follow the border setting, but the latter one will not.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <table border="8px" class="rightsidebar">
        <tr>
            <td><img src="../images/Prime_preview.jpg" alt="Optimus Prime" /></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="caption">Pax is the formal name of Optimus Prime. He was an orinary person of Cybertron, who took charge of management of a library. But he is a man who has a dream for the world of justice, peace and freedom. So the all spark chose him to be the new prime. </td>
