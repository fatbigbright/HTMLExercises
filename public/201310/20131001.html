            From today, I will spend several days to follow Chapter 16 of the book &lt;HTML, XHTML &amp; CSS 6th edition&gt; to create a page with table. During this period, page of every day will be copied from the one edited yesterday and updated.

No one won in the war, and homeland had to be abandoned. Then they come to earth, millions of years ago, when human have not appeared yet. But they did not wake up until 1990s A.D. The stage changed to this blue planet, and the actors are not only the transformers, but also the human beings.</p>
